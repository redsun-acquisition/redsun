r"""Motor controller module. It provides a basic protocol to interface with motorized devices.

Motor controllers are the direct link between the respective models and the user interface. \
Signals emitted from the UI are captured by the controller, and are appropriately \
translated into commands that the motor can execute. Usually when a workflow is running, \
this connection is disabled to prevent accidental user input from interfering with the workflow execution.
