# RedSun

RedSun is an acquisition software written in [CPython], with the concept of building modular user interfaces for scientific data acquisition.

It leverages the [Bluesky] ecosystem to provide a flexible, hardware-agnostic and unopinionated framework for building a control software tailored to the specific needs of different users in different scientific fields.

The philosophy of RedSun is to:

- not "reinvent the wheel", but rather "ship the tools to build the wheel";
- being extensible and modular: pick only the tools you need to get the job done;
- give the control of your data (and metadata) to you: you decide what is what.
