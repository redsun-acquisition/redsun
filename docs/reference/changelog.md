## [0.5.0] - 17-02-2026

### Changed

- Fully refactor the package to go towards a containerization approach
  - Declare applications as containers, list relevant components as fields of a class
  - Provide support also for building from a configuration file as before
- Upgrade to `sunflare>=0.9.0`
- Move the `FrontendTypes` and `ViewPositionTypes` from `sunflare` to `redsun`
  - They're part of the overall configuration and should not concern the core package

## [0.4.0] - 15-12-2025

### Changed

- Apply a more strict check on imported plugins
- Add support for 3.13 (simply declared on PyPI and tested via CI)
- Upgrade to `sunflare>=0.7.0`

## [0.3.0] - 04-07-2025

### Changed

- Upgraded to `sunflare>=0.6.1`
- Switch to `uv`
- Drop support for Python 3.9

## [0.2.0] - 03-03-2025

### Changed

- Reworked the plugin system
  - The approach now loosely follows the [`napari` manifest](https://napari.org/stable/plugins/technical_references/manifest.html), where plugins are to be published via a `yaml` configuration file in the root folder of the plugin package, specifiying where the classes have to be imported.
  - The manifest is taken as the actual entry point of a plugin, which will be used to redirect to the actual imports which is executed via the standard library `importlib`.
- Added additional coverage for the ``factory`` module.
- Bumped sunflare version to ``sunflare>=0.5.0``, which implements the above changes at toolkit level

## [0.1.0] - 22-02-2025
